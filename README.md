# inventory-management-system

Design and implement a system for Inventory Management that allows users to easily find specific inventory items across different stores and categories. Incorporate product management into the system, managing product details, categories, and availability across different stores. The system will also handle transactions between stores, and manage users and roles. Key features include Inventory Management, Transaction Management, User & Role Management. The architecture will follow the MVC model, using Flutter for the frontend, getx for state management, SQFlite for local storage, and implement secure password storage and role-based access control.
